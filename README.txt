This project is an implementation of the infix and postfix calculator. For more information, please visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation
I created various data structures such Stacks and Queues to make the calculations work. 


This was a very complex program that took a lot of time. Simply run the Main Class and include infix_expr_short.txt , my_eval.txt , and postfix.txt.
Please make sure these three files are there, otherwise the program wont work.

Note: I made the program compatible with exponent, modulo, sine, cosine, and tangent.
